## Description

"Simply Scent by CK" is a simple three-page e-commerce web application for a scented products brand.

The website allows users to:
- Browse scented products
- Search and filter products
- Sort products by price
- Add and remove items from a shopping cart
- Update item quantities
- Complete checkout using different payment options
- Subscribe to a newsletter

The cart data is saved using **localStorage**, so items remain even after refreshing the page.
